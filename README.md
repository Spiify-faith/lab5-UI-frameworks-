# lab5-UI frameworks
intorduction to some UI frameworks  (tailwind,bootsrap and react) how they work and their differences.

# What i've learnt about the frameworks
-Tailwind
its a utility-first CSS framework that lets us style our websites directly in our HTML using small, reusable classes. Instead of writing custom CSS, we use Tailwind’s predefined classes to control things like layout, spacing, colors, and fonts, making it fast and flexible for building modern, responsive designs.

-Bootstrap
 It has open source code with pre-designed components like buttons and navigation bars, so we don’t have to start from scratch , we just put the pieces together and we're done.

-React
React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It allows us to create reusable components, making it easier for us to manage complex UIs by breaking them into smaller, interactive parts.
